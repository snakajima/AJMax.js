.SH "Conditional GET"
The \fIconditionalGet\fR middleware supports conditional GET requests, which validates the "freshness" of a response body\. Currently supports:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIIf\-Modified\-Since\fR\. When a response status is \fI200\fR, and \fILast\-Modified\fR less than or equal to this time, the response body and \fIContent\-*\fR headers will be stripped, responding with 304 "Not Modified"\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIIf\-None_Match\fR\. Performs a similar validation, however compares the \fIETag\fR for equality\.
.
.IP "" 0
