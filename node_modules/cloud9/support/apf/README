  APF - Ajax.org Platform
  ========================================

  APF[1] introduces you to writing Rich Internet Applications (RIA's) using
Ajax. Giving you and your users the best of both worlds, your web applications
run in a browser, yet look and feel like compiled desktop applications.
Connecting to external data sources can be done by using Ajax.org TelePort.
